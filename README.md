# Text Analysis App

This is my fourth project for the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The app makes a call to an external sentiment analysis API and sends back a JSON file that is then processed so the right information is displayed in the user interface.

It contains the following features:

1. It's been built with the package bundler Webpack
1. There is a development and a production mode with different configurations
1. Babel is used to make the app compatible with older versions of Javascript
1. The server is build with Node and it contains a route for making the API calls
1. The API calls are made through Fetch and the keys are hidden in a .env file for security

The app is also responsive and uses SASS for the UI styling.
